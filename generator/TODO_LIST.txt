[I.] get simplistic crystal demo working with p5js, jnordberg
https://p5js.org/reference/ 
https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js/

[II.] build out Druse:
    0) resize mother canvas
    1) import and resize all auxiliary data [should probably pre-compute the resizing?]
    2) Druse configuration load file
    3) Upgrade druse grower 
    4) Write to frames
    5) Optimize: write on the fly without computing entire crystal growth?
    -1) search files for TODO
